				<h2>SKYPE DESIGN</h2>
									
				<p>I've been with Skype since September 2013 and have opportunities to get involved in quite a few exciting product teams such as Skype Mobile, Skype Qik (an experimental mobile app), and Skype for living room. My responsibilities cover all aspects of the design process from concept development, user experience and visual design, prototyping, specification, to implementation. At Skype, I work closely with both business and technical partners to make sure all products shipped with the highest possible quality. Below are some more details of projects I worked on.</p>

				<h3 style="text-transform: none;">SKYPE FOR iOS</h3>
				<h4>June 2015 – Present</h4>
				<p>Skype on iOS has gone through a few different design iterations in the past. Before this update, Skype on iPhone had adopted Metro UI design pattern from Windows Phone which, we learnt, was rather difficult for iOS users to understand and get used to. For iPad, there was a lack of core features such as group calling and rich media messaging, whilst the general visual look and feel was in need of a refresh. The universal app re-design also gave us opportunity to ensure the Skype experience across all iOS devices felt more seamless and tightly connected.</p>
				
				<img class="large" src="../_images/skype_ios1.jpg">	
				
				<p>The redesign greatly focussed on improving usability and feature discoverability, which made the application become more natural and intuitive to navigate around. Whether on iPhone or iPad the experience is the same.</p>
				
				<p>Apart from the improved user experience, the application is now much more scalable. During the redesign, we factored in upcoming works in our roadmap and created a foundation that can accomodate new features. This helps streamline the development process because we can keep building thing on top of the structure we have.</p>

				<h3>Mobile Group Video Calls</h3>
				<h4>December 2015 – Present</h4>
				<p>10 years ago, Skype introduced video call to the world. Since then, it helped transform life of many people. It had forever changed the way we communicate and collaborate in everyday life. And today we are taking another big step forward. Today, where mobile devices have become even more ubiquitous than desktop or laptop. Today, we are shipping group video call to mobile! I'm very proud to be a part of the team to craft a brand new experience of Skype group video call in mobile, and really excited to see how it will, again, improve life of hundreds of millions people around the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/7AuhjzxAudY" target="window">See it in action</a></p>

				<h3>Skype Qik</h3>
				<h4>June 2014 – May 2015</h4>
				<p>In a nut shell, Skype Qik is a speedy video messaging mobile app. It is the first experimental mobile app from Skype which aimed to extend Skype experience into a new territory. It's simple, fast, and focuses on rich video conversation which will allow family and friends to share daily moments.</p>
				
				<p>One of our biggest challenges in this project is that we had a very limited resource, tight timeline, and we also had to collaborate with engineering team who located across the atlantic to build the application on multiple platform (iOS, Android, and Windows Phone). Once we shipped, the app was well received by our users as well as many tech media sites. It was also chosen as one of the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/promotion_3000f13_best_of_2014" target="window">best apps of 2014</a> by Google Play Store.</p>

				<h3>Skype for TV & Companion Device</h3>
				<h4>October 2013 – April 2014</h4>
				<p>Skype living room experience was the first product team I was in after joining Skype in September 2013. Our team was responsible for crafting delightful Skype experience on large screens and I was tasked to design a brand new Skype for TV web application.</p>
				
				<img class="large" src="../_images/skype_tv1.jpg">
				
				<p>The challenge in this project was particularly around understanding the user behaviour interacting with TV devices where the main interface is neither touchscreen nor mouse and keyboard, instead a very limited-function remote control. Navigating around on TV is not as easy as on mobile or PC, so we had to come up with a user interface that doesn't require much navigation.</p>
				
				
				<p>During the project I also explored how Skype TV could work with a companion device. The goal was to create an experience that allows user to seamlessly transfer calls between different devices, as well as to control the TV using touch screen. To communicate the idea to stakeholders, I created a prototype with HTML and Javascript using Node.js which enables PC and mobile to talk to each other. <a href="mailto:soramist@gmail.com"> Get in touch</a> if you would like to know more about it.</p>
