				<h3>Social Network in your Kitchen.</h3>
				<h4>October 2008 (4 weeks)</h4>
				
				
				<p>Kitchen mate was the first project in my design education, I had learned a lot about design process and creative methods during the project. The main objective was to design a kitchen device, it could be a personal shopper, kitchen timer or scale or combined.</p>
				<p>Since this was my first design project, I had written down the process overview In order to clarify the overall process and also to keep myself on track whenever I got lost in between the project.</p>

				<h3>Design exploration</h3>
				<p>Owing to the globalisation and internet rage, people are changing their behaviour of communication. Many people prefer to spend more time immersing in social network communities such as Facebook and Myspace rather than having physical relationships with the one who lives next door. My approach was to design a device that will stimulate physical interaction among the target users which are students or people who live in small scale communal space such as apartment or corridor.</p>
				<p>I was also inspired by Tamagochi, japanese electronic pet. I tried to make the product to be simple and does not contain high technology components and more user friendly. The design directions were including...</p>
				<p>- Allow users to enjoy spending their time in the kitchen.</br>
				- Provide convenience to user during shopping time. </br>
				- Simplicity, user friendly, easy to approach.</br>
				- Provide technical and emotional solutions.
				</p>

				<h3>Final Design</h3>
				<p>Kitchen mate is a multi-purpose device for multi-user, which aims to create small scale physical social network in common living spaces such as student dormitory, in order to strengthen their relationships by stimulating social interaction among them focussing on the kitchen environment.</p>
				<p>The device composes of two parts, main body and a passive speaker. Users can use either together or separately. With magnetic surface it can stay one refrigerator in the kitchen. Users can synchronise database through wireless connection by using widget on their computer.</p>
				<p>Here I had made a scenario of using the device, click to play >>>
